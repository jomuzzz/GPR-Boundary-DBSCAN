This repository provides a graphical analysis tool for Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) signals.
It includes functions for envelope extraction, peak/valley detection, boundary point identification, DBSCAN clustering, and curve fitting for structural analysis.
The tool is developed as part of an ongoing research project, and the related paper is currently under peer review.
